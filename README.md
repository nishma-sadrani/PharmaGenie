# PharmaGenie
PharmaGenie is designed to provide alternative medicine suggestions when a specific drug is unavailable, out of stock, or difficult to obtain. This system uses a combination of machine learning and pharmacological data to recommend equivalent medicines based on the active ingredients, dosage forms, therapeutic effects, and other relevant factors.
